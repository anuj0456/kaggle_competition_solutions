# Competition Details

## Goal

The objective of this competition is to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict the binding affinity of small molecules to specific protein targets – a critical step in drug development for the pharmaceutical industry that would pave the way for more accurate drug discovery. You’ll help predict which drug-like small molecules (chemicals) will bind to three possible protein targets.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using average precision calculated for each (protein, split group) and then averaged for the final score.
