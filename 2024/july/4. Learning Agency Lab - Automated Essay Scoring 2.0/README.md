# Competition Details

## Goal

The objective of this competition is to train a model to score student essays. Your efforts are needed to reduce the high expense and time required to hand grade these essays. Reliable automated techniques could allow essays to be introduced in testing, a key indicator of student learning that is currently commonly avoided due to the challenges in grading.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated based on the quadratic weighted kappa, which measures the agreement between two outcomes. This metric typically varies from 0 (random agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). In the event that there is less agreement than expected by chance, the metric may go below 0.
