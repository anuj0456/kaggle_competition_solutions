# Competition Details

## Goal

This competition challenges you to predict which responses users will prefer in a head-to-head battle between chatbots powered by large language models (LLMs). You'll be given a dataset of conversations from the Chatbot Arena, where different LLMs generate answers to user prompts. By developing a winning machine learning model, you'll help improve how chatbots interact with humans and ensure they better align with human preferences.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the log loss between the predicted probabilities and the ground truth values (with "eps=auto").
