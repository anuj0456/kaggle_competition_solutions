# Competition Details

## Goal

The objective of this competition is to develop machine learning models that accurately emulate subgrid-scale atmospheric physics in an operational climate model—an important step in improving climate projections and reducing uncertainty surrounding future climate trends.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using a custom R-squared metric for evaluation, but on a weighted solution.
𝑅^2 = 1 − 𝑆𝑆𝑟𝑒𝑠/𝑆𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡
