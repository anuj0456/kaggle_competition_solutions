## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using minimize the value of the objective function, \\(S\\), which is given by

𝑆=𝑡𝑓∗log(1+𝑛𝑒)
where

\\(t_f\\) is the last minute the final toy is complete, from reference date January 1, 2014 12:00 AM
\\(n_e\\) is the number of unique elves that were needed to build the toys
