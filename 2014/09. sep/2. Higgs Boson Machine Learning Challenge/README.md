# Competition Details

## Goal

The objective of this competition is a function of the weights of selected events. We expect that significant improvements are possible by re-visiting some of the ad hoc choices in the standard procedure, or by incorporating the objective function or a surrogate into the classifier design.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the approximate median significance (AMS):

`AMS=√2((𝑠+𝑏+𝑏𝑟)log(1+𝑠𝑏+𝑏𝑟)−𝑠)`
