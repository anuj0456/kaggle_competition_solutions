# Competition Details

## Goal

The objective of this competition is to predict the network connectivity for the validation (valid) and test data.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated using the so-called Area Under ROC Curve (AUC), which we refer to as AUC. It corresponds to the area under the curve obtained by plotting the "True positive ratio" against the "False positive ratio" by varying a threshold on the prediction values to determine the classification result. The AUC is calculated using the trapezoid method.
