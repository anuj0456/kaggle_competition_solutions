In order to reproduce our final packing, one needs to do the following.

1. Compile the programs:
make pack
make masterimploder
2. Transform the presents list from a CSV file, to a file where subsequent integers are separated by spaces instead of comas, and there is no header (this can be done in any reasonable editor).
3. Run the program:
./pack < presents.txt > answer.csv
4. Run the optimizer (masterimploder):
./masterimploder 
5. The final packing will be in the optimized.csv file.
